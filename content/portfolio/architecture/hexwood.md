This research project studies and analyses the performance of timber laminates with MUF (melamine urea-formaldehyde) resin and wood particles (sawdust). Timber laminates are pre-programmed by understanding its behavior through simulations with the help of computational tools. Advanced learning and using digital tools will always help to push boundaries for understanding a material better. Its properties to react with different materials, applied forces, physical attributes etc. is crucial to investigate in order to understand their behavior, especially while studying those of new composites.
