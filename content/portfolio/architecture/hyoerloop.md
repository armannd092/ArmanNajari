Hyperloop LA was experimentation on the minimal surfaces as an architectural geometry to contain a hyperloop station in Los Angeles.
This study started by base component study and continued toward a parametric development of it. With the manipulation of the geometry regardless of the architectural function the capability of the component has been found. Based on this knowledge, a broad catalog of the component was produced, which was the foundation of the final design of the station. Hyperloop stationâ€ºs primary function was obtained from the Elon Musk initiative of hyperloop between LA and San Francisco.
