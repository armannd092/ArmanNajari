The agenda is to further push the fabrication of curved surfaces with composite materials. However this time, the design studies of the work will be shifted from pure mathematics to the work and legacy of Felix Candela which still features a good deal of math and geometry in his works. By ‘Re-Envisioning Candela’, the idea is to study the intricacy as well as technicality and methodology of his work and to push it towards further computational design of the shell/surface geometries. Using the strategies like hyperbolic paraboloid geometries and ruled surfaces to generate ultra-thin shell structures, the aim is to see the potentials and embed them in the design of composite surface geometries.
