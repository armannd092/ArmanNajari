Good wood is a new perspective to Recycling wood with the help of computational design and robotic fabrication. This project tries to present a process to target the scrap wood, which left from the construction as a base material to build a shelter. This approach gets advantages from computational tools and robotic fabrication to detect, match, and fabricate the elements of the shell.
