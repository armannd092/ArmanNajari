COVID Map is Live map visualization which demonstrates peoples feeling about the coronavirus outbreak. It is watching public tweets and tries to understand if they are positive or negative. In this manner, it uses vectorizing each word base on its dictionary. 
One of my discoveries from this map is the countries that have access restrictions to this social media like China and Iran. Also, the limitation of this system is that it can just understand English.
