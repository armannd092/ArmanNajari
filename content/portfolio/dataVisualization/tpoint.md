T-point is an experience on how robot arm can sense and interact with human. In the first phase the robot has to be aware of its position in the environment. The next challenge is to recognize the user in the environment. Later on user can have live interaction with robot. Moreover by taking the control of the robot you will be able to compose sounds and lights.
