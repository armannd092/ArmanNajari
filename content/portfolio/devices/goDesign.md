Digital world and rise of modern computers have affected our life in various ways. Yet architecture is one of this fields that thrives on the digital phenomena to promote new perspectives in desing and fabrication through this age. However, current CAD tools and softwares are still far less than perfect in the way they interact with humans. Thus in a quest to develop more innate ways for human-computer interaction we came up with the idea of Glove Operation Design.
The main concept of GoDesign is combining traditional sketching and CAD (computer assistant design). based on this core concept, the challenge was to find a tool that everyone can work with without any specific consideration. 
GoDesign utilizes the most common sketching    tool that can be directly controlled by brain, and of course is a part of body; HUMAN HAND.
Thus we customized a glove by using Arduino lilypad, a Bluetooth module and related wiring. The GoDesing Glove can send different finger states to computer while hand motion is recorded by a Kinect sensor. The combination of finger states and motion data is then processed in a Rhino Grasshopper Plugin written in C# and various forms like curves, lines, circle, etc. are produced. 
In near future, a pair of augmented reality glasses (or lenses) will be included in GoDesing to make sketching possible in real world.
