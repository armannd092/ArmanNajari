This project aims to design and fabricate a 2*1.2 meter acoustic panel. For designing, an agent-based approach has been obtained to maximize the cavity in the solid material and trap the sound wave into itself. In the fabrication strategy, the double-side CNC milling approach with a 12mm flat bite has been applied
