PlanGo is a new way to interface with schedule planning. For many years we tend to plan our upcoming daily life to optimize our time and resources. This device tends to find the middle ground between 100% digital planning platform and paper base planning. Each of these has its advantage and disadvantages. For instance, Digital calendars are the best in synchronizing your time with colleges and across different devices. However, they are often complicated to work with it. On the other hand, paper-based planning is quick and accessible. But you can share it with others easily and they can be lost. Hence, PlanGO offers a simple and accessible table device which can hold your plan in sync with your online calendar, and show your upcoming events.
